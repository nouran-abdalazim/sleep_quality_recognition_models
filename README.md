Personalization is All You Need: The Impact of Domain Shift on the Performance of Sleep Quality Recognition Models

This repository includes an excerpt of the full code repository used to develop the _``Personalization is All You Need: The Impact of Domain Shift on the Performance of Sleep Quality Recognition Models''_
 paper. 
 
The paper is under review at the ``Sensors Network and Wearables for People Activities and Wellbeing Monitoring'' special issue of the Sensors journal (https://www.mdpi.com/si/sensors/41XQ0PVNXQ).

In this excerpt, we include:
- The implementation for the ``single dataset scenario'' for training and evaluation of ML models in sleep quality recognition task.
- The implementation for the ``multiple datasets scenario'' for training and evaluation of ML models in sleep quality recognition task.
- The implementation for the statistical comparison between the datasets to explore ``domain shift'', i.e., covariate shift.
